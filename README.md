# shell243

A simple shell. See [grammar.ebnf](./grammar.ebnf) for details about
the parser.

Make sure you have GNU Readline installed and compile with `make`. By
default, it is compiled with `-DDEBUG`, which makes it print the AST
after each command. To disable this, compile with `make DEFS=""`.

To exit out of the shell type use C-d.
